## Overview

LinkedIn URL Finder is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of searching and retrieving LinkedIn profile URLs for a list of individuals. This tool is particularly useful for professionals in recruitment, sales, and marketing who require a quick and efficient way to gather LinkedIn information.

## Features

- **Error Handling**: Implements exponential backoff strategy to handle HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multi-threading to speed up the search process across multiple data chunks.
- **Configurable**: Allows customization through a JSON configuration file.
- **Logging**: Provides detailed logs for monitoring the program's progress and troubleshooting issues.
- **easy to use**: You can run the script on your Windows machine without installing Python.
